# Cefalo Timeout Extension

The Cefalo Timeout Extension enhances the attendance reports in the Cefalo HR Portal by adding a "Secure End Time" column and displaying time spent information since the first entry.

## Features

- **Secure End Time Column**: Automatically calculates and displays the recommended leave time based on minimum required hours.

- **Time Spent Calculation**: Shows the duration spent since the first entry to help users track their attendance.

- **Local Processing**: All data processing occurs locally within the user's browser without transmitting any personal information.

## Installation

You can install the Cefalo Timeout Extension directly from the [Chrome Web Store]('#') once it's published.
